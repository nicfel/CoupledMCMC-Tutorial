@article{Bouckaert2014,
abstract = {We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

	abstract = {When populations become isolated, members of these populations can diverge genetically over time. This leads to genetic differences between individuals of these populations that increase over time if the isolation persists. This process can be counteracted when genes are exchanged between populations. In order to study the speciation processes when gene flow is present, isolation-with-migration methods have been developed. These methods typically assume that the ranked topology of the species history is already known. However, this is often not the case and the species tree is therefore of interest itself. To infer it is currently only possible when assuming no gene flow. This assumption can lead to wrongly inferred speciation times and species tree topologies. Building on a recently introduced structured coalescent approach, we introduce a new method that allows inference of the species tree while explicitly modelling the flow of genes between coexisting species. By using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, we co-infer the species tree alongside evolutionary parameters of interest. By using simulations, we show that our newly introduced approach is able to reliably infer the species trees and parameters of the isolation-with-migration model from genetic sequence data. We then infer the species history of six great ape species including gene flow after population isolation. By using this dataset, we are able to show that our new methods is able to infer the correct species tree not only on simulated but also on a real data set where the species history has already been well studied. In line with previous results, we find some support for some gene flow between bonobos and common chimpanzees.},
